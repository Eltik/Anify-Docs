# Providers
Anify uses multiple providers as its sources. The following list are providers that Anify uses.

## Base Providers
**Important note**: Base providers use ID's derived from the website itself. For example, if MangaDex is a base provider, the `id` field in the information response will be the MangaDex ID. Base providers also take information directly from the website itself for other data. For example, seasonal data is taken directly from AniList for `/seasonal` routes. The base provider will usually contain more information than any other provider (eg. TVDB, TMDB, etc.); hence why it is a "base" provider.
