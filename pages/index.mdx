## About
### What is Anify?
Anify is a popular website for streaming anime, reading manga, and reading light novels. Unlike most websites, it contains everything you might need for jumping into the Japanese media genre. Most websites only contain anime, manga, or light novels; never both, and certainly not all three. Anify aims to revolutionize the meaning of anime and manga websites by combining all three into one place.

### What is this documentation for?
The purpose of this documentation is to teach others how to code using the API for Anify. The documentation you see now is just a basic framework/introduction on how to use the routes. To fully make use of Anify's backend, you can view the sections on the left-hand side for how to use the API. If you need further support, please join our [Discord](https://anify.tv/discord).

### What separates Anify from other API's?
Anify has been developed for many years and has gone through many improvements, optimizations, and recodes to achieve the best performance and best results possible. Anify is also one of the only API's that provides all three Japanese media genres in one place. Anify also has a very large database of anime, manga, and light novels, and is constantly being updated with new content. With over 10,000 shows and a growing library of manga and novels, Anify is the best choice for your Japanese media needs.
