## About
### What is Anify?
Anify is a popular website for streaming anime, reading manga, and reading light novels. Unlike most websites, it contains everything you might need for jumping into the Japanese media genre. Most websites only contain anime, manga, or light novels; never both, and certainly not all three. Anify aims to revolutionize the meaning of anime and manga websites by combining all three into one place.
