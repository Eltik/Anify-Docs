# Introduction
Welcome to the documentation for Anify API! This documentation shows you the routes for Anify and how to use it.

## About
### What is Anify?
Anify is a popular website for streaming anime, reading manga, and reading light novels. Unlike most websites, it contains everything you might need for jumping into the Japanese media genre. Most websites only contain anime, manga, or light novels; never both, and certainly not all three. Anify aims to revolutionize the meaning of anime and manga websites by combining all three into one place.

### What is this documentation for?

Please contact Eltik for an API key, as at the time of the documentation release API keys will likely be required to use any of the routes. The documentation you see now is just the introduction.
